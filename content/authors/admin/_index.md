I’m a senior at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) studying Social Policy Analysis & Political Science and minoring in data science. I’m interested in data visualization and public policy (and their intersection!), and my go-to tools for exploring those topics are D3.js and R.

Right now, I'm working as a data science intern with the [US Special Operations Command](https://www.socom.mil/) through a fellowship with [Coding it Forward](https://www.codingitforward.com/). 

Previously, I've worked with the [Texas Policy Lab](https://www.texaspolicylab.org/) as a data scientist, the [Religion and Public Life Program](https://rplp.rice.edu/) as an undergraduate fellow, and the [Baker Instute for Public Policy](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/) as a research assistant.
