# My Personal Site

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fc98ef2f-ceba-4684-abd5-ba749ed8d708/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/flamboyant-meitner-43489f/deploys)

My personal website, built using the R package [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), the [Hugo Academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) theme, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Some things unique to my site:
* The homepage is animated using some special CSS properties ([see the blog post](https://connorrothschild.com/post/animate-hugo-academic)).
* I created some custom CSS to create pretty underlines on hover of URLs ([see the SCSS file](https://github.com/connorrothschild/connorrothschild.com/blob/master/assets/scss/custom.scss)).
* The experience tab is built using a custom widget, which is why they also have logos ([see the widget](https://github.com/connorrothschild/connorrothschild.com/blob/master/layouts/partials/widgets/experience.html))
* Some style changes were inspired by [this blog post](https://isabella-b.com/blog/hugo-academic-customization/#full-list-of-theme-colors-you-can-customize) by [Isabella Benabaye](https://isabella-b.com/), which I would recommend to any Hugo Academic user.
