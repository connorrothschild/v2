# My Personal Site

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fc98ef2f-ceba-4684-abd5-ba749ed8d708/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/flamboyant-meitner-43489f/deploys)

My personal website, built using the R package [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), the [Hugo Academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) theme, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Significant style changes were inspired by [this blog post](https://isabella-b.com/blog/hugo-academic-customization/#full-list-of-theme-colors-you-can-customize) by [Isabella Benabaye](https://isabella-b.com/), which I would recommend to any Hugo Academic user.
